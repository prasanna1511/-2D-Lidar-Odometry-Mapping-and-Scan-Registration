### Modern C++ 2024 Final Project: 2D Lidar odometry in the Real-World 



# Lidar Odometry Project

calculate motion by indentation and pose by aggregation 
## Table of Contents

- Load data
- find nearest neighbors
- check correspondences
- compute transformations
- accumulate transformation for consecutive scans


## Introduction

This project aims to implement 2D Lidar Odometry using C++. Lidar data is stored in binary files (.bin).

## Setup

To run this project, you will need:

- C++ compiler (supporting C++17)
- Eigen library for linear algebra operations
- Open3D library for 3D visualization

```
./build/main data
```
first scan of 2D lidar dat will look as ![ScreenCapture_2024-07-01-15-37-39](https://github.com/prasanna1511/2D-Lidar-Odometry/assets/53254596/4deb6fae-0451-40b2-b16b-c516c7d5a993)
